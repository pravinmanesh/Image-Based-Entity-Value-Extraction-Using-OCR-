# Image-Based-Entity-Value-Extraction-Using-OCR-
This Python project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract entity values (like voltage, wattage, weight, dimensions) from product images. The extracted values are compared with actual values to ensure accurate predictions. It handles various units of measurement and converts them into human-readable formats for consistency.
